# InspiringApps Challenge

This is my solution application to the InspiringApps JavaScript Challenge. Included are two seperate solution tools - one built with ReactJS + the ReactDnD library and the other built with vanilla JavaScript + the HTML5 Canvas API.

Enjoy! 

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository locally, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start             # Spins up server on localhost:3000, using nodemon
                            # Compiles Webpack, with -p flag
```
